      <p>The Terrence Building was first opened in 1959 as a
	psychiatric hospital building in addition to housing a
	geriatrics facility. It became the new home of the Rochester
	State Hospital, which had existed since 1891 after replacing
	the Monroe County Insane Asylum. The tower had a different
	department on each floor, in addition to a general hospital on
	the 13th and 14th floor, with the 5th floor housing the
	criminally insane and the basement holding a lab and
	morgue. During the building's history, there were definitely
	no allegations of patient abuse within the tower's
	premises. Furthermore, we definitely don't believe that any
	patients are "lost causes, impossible to reintegrate with
	society" and definitely nobody is essentially just locked away
	inside the tower.
