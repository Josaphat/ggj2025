	    <h2>History</h2>
	    <ul>
	    <li>
	      <b>Abandoned Terrence Building: </b> One of Rawchester's
	      tallest buildings, the former home of the Rochester
	      Psychiatric Hospital. The Terrence Building was first
	      opened in 1959 as a psychiatric hospital building in
	      addition to housing a geriatrics facility.[4] It became
	      the new home of the Rochester State Hospital, which had
	      existed since 1891 after replacing the Monroe County
	      Insane Asylum.[5][6] The tower had a different
	      department on each floor, in addition to a general
	      hospital on the 13th and 14th floor, with the 5th floor
	      housing the criminally insane and the basement holding a
	      lab and morgue. During the building's history,
	      allegations of patient abuse within the tower's premises
	      often surfaced.[7] Furthermore, many of the patients
	      were treated as "lost causes, impossible to reintegrate
	      with society" and were essentially locked away inside
	      the tower.[8]

	      <p>The tower was eventually closed down in
		1995. <a href="terrencearchive.html">See an archived
