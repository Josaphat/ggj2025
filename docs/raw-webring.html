                <li>
                    <b>Weak Museum of Torture Devices: </b> Are you interested in Brazen Bulls? Iron Maidens? That stretchy thing in the <i>Princess Bride</i>? Well, this is the place for you. See a number of torture devices that are claimed to be medieval but probably just invented by the Victorians! <a href="">Get your tickets here. Family discounts apply!</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Private Market: </b> The most secretive place of commerce in Rawchester! Bring your robes and Masonic emblem and maybe, just maybe, you'll get into this place under city hall. Don't know where to go? Just follow the pyramid eye iconography, you won't miss it.<br />
                    And there will be no orgies, we definitely don't have orgies here.
